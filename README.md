## Accomplishments and Bonus Request (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

We would like to highlight the following accomplishments which we believe warrant a bonus:

## Partially Completed Work (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

While we strived to complete all aspects of the project, the following parts are not fully completed:

- **Internationalization** - Due to time constraints, we could not implement multi-language support.
