## System Building Procedure (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

The system was built using the following procedure and key components:

1. **Setup Development Environment** - Configured the local development environment with necessary tools and dependencies.
2. **Database Integration** - We integrated a [Your Database Package] for robust data management and retrieval.
3. **Coding Standards** - Followed best practices in coding standards to ensure readability and maintainability.
4. **Version Control** - Utilized Git for version control, with systematic commits and descriptive messages.
5. **Testing and Debugging** - Wrote unit and integration tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
6. **Deployment** - Deployed the application on the Render server using continuous deployment pipelines.

## Accomplishments and Bonus Request (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

We would like to highlight the following accomplishments which we believe warrant a bonus:

- **Optimized Performance** - We have implemented caching and optimized queries, which have significantly improved the system's performance.
- **Responsive Design** - The application features a fully responsive design that works across various devices and screen sizes.

## Partially Completed Work (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

While we strived to complete all aspects of the project, the following parts are not fully completed:

- **Internationalization** - Due to time constraints, we could not implement multi-language support.
- **Advanced Search** - The advanced search functionality is currently limited and does not support all planned features.

We appreciate your understanding and consideration when grading the project.
