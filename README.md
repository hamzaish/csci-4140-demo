## Directory Structure and Functionality

Below is an outline of the project's directory structure along with a description of the contents and functionality of each directory and file.

- `/web` - Contains all the source code files for the project.

## System Building Procedure

The system was built using the following procedure and key components:

1. **Setup Development Environment** - Configured the local development environment using Docker and installed required dependencies.
2. **Database Integration** - We integrated a PDO and Postgres SGL database for robust data management and retrieval.
3. **Version Control** - Utilized Git for version control, with systematic commits and descriptive messages.
4. **Deployment** - Deployed the application on the Render server using continuous deployment pipelines.

## Accomplishments and Bonus Request

We would like to highlight the following accomplishments which we believe warrant a bonus:

- **Log-in and Log-off** - Ability to log in and out of the web service using cookies; ability to save private images to user.
- **Upload and Edit Images** - User can upload and edit an image using the services' two filters.
- **Sorted Album and Pagination** - Webpage shows 8 images at a time and user can use previous and next to go through them.
- **Editing Features** - User can make uploaded picture black and white or add a black border around image; user can choose to discard or upload the image.
- **BONUS Added Initialization** - Admins can reset database using the button on the photos.php page.
- **BONUS Added Some Field Validation** - Users will not be able to submit password or username unless both are filled in; cannot submit nothing as a file.

## Partially Completed Work (Just for your reference! You should not copy any of these!)

While we strived to complete all aspects of the project, the following parts are not fully completed:

- **Internationalization** - Due to time constraints, we could not implement multi-language support.
- **Advanced Search** - The advanced search functionality is currently limited and does not support all planned features.

We appreciate your understanding and consideration when grading the project.
